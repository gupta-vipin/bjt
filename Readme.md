[**1: Introduction to BJTs**](introduction)

*   The bipolar junction transistor (BJT) was invented in 1948. 
*   A BJT is a three-terminal device that uses a small current at its base to control a larger current flowing between the emitter and collector.
*   BJTs are used in many electronic circuits.
*   This handbook explains the fundamentals of BJTs, describes device structures, and gives an overview of the main process steps in fabrication.

**2: Advantages of BJTs**

*   BJTs have better power handling capacity than MOSFETs, making them a better choice for high-power applications.
*   They are suitable for analog applications and have a more linear relationship between their input and output signals when operating in the active region. 
*   BJTs have been around much longer than MOSFETs so there's more collective knowledge and trusted design methodologies for using them.
*   Today, billions of BJTs are produced every year and installed in myriad electrical and electronic equipment types. 

**3: Types of BJTs**

*   There are several classes of BJTs that target different applications.
*   **General-purpose transistors** offer the best balance between performance and cost if your application has no specific demands.
*   **Low VCEsat transistors** are designed for switching applications because of their low collector-emitter saturation voltage (VCEsat). 
*   **Matched-pair transistors** are designed to have very similar characteristics, making them ideal for use in applications such as differential amplifiers.
*   **Resistor-equipped transistors (RETs)** have one or two integrated resistors.
*   **LED driver transistors** are specifically designed to drive LEDs.

**4: BJT Packages**

*   BJTs are available in a wide range of surface-mount device (SMD) packages.
*   These packages range from the legacy SOT23 package to the most modern in the industry, including leadless and clip flat power (CFP) packages.
*   **Leaded packages** include wire-bonded lead packages such as SOT23, SOT89, and DPAK, as well as clip flat power (CFP) packages for increased power requirements.
*   **Leadless packages** include dual-flat-no-leads (DFN) packages, which are qualified for automotive use.

**5: BJT Data Sheet Parameters** 

*   To select the right BJT for your application, it's crucial to understand the data sheet parameters.
*   Key parameters include:
    *   **Breakdown voltages:** The maximum voltage that can be applied to the transistor's terminals without causing it to fail.
    *   **Leakage currents:** The small current that flows through the transistor when it is turned off.
    *   **DC current gain (hFE):** The ratio of collector current to base current.
    *   **Saturation voltage (VCEsat):** The voltage across the collector-emitter path when the transistor is turned on.
    *   **Switching times:** How quickly the transistor can turn on and off.
    *   **Capacitances:** The parasitic capacitances between the transistor's terminals.
    *   **Thermal resistance:** A measure of how well the transistor can dissipate heat.

**6:  BJT Applications**

*   BJTs are used in a wide range of analog and digital circuits.
*   **Analog applications** include amplifiers, current mirrors, and voltage regulators.
*   **Digital applications** include logic gates, flip-flops, and oscillators.
*   BJTs can be used in audio circuits, such as signal generators, voltage-controlled oscillators, and filters.
*   They are also used as gate drivers for power semiconductors like IGBTs and MOSFETs.

**7: BJT Simulation and Software Analysis**

*   Software simulation is a valuable tool for BJT circuit design.
*   Simulation tools can be used to:
    *   **Predict circuit behavior:** You can understand how the BJT will operate under different conditions before building a physical prototype.
    *   **Optimize circuit performance:** Parameters like bias voltage and component values can be adjusted to achieve desired output characteristics.
    *   **Troubleshoot circuit issues:**  Simulation helps identify potential problems in the design phase, saving time and effort.
*   **LTspice** is a powerful and widely-used SPICE simulator for analyzing BJT circuits.
*   Nexperia provides **Foster and Cauer RC models** that can be used in SPICE or other simulation tools to simulate junction temperature rise in transient conditions.
